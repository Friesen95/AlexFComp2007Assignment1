                Due to the fact that I am still in collage i have not thought about the services I am willing to provide since mypriority is paying for school
    and doing well in my courses. However I do feel comfortable creating Web apps or even Applications involving Java, C# and by the end of this semester C++.
            Once I am done with collage I will start to persue more private projects and will offer some services part time.
